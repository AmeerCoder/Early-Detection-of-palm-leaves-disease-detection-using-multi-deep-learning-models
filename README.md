**Project Title Early Detection of Palm Leaves Disease Dectection using deep learning models** 


**Abstract**
Palm trees are among the earliest species known to humanity, having been cultivated since 
antiquity. Heavenly religions bestowed reverence upon palm trees and devoted considerable 
attention to their maintenance. Palm cultivation is significant in Arab societies not only 
because it provides nutrition, but also because it is connected with long-standing customs, 
traditions, and social values. In recent times, artificial intelligence has been employed to 
develop predictive models for disease risks across diverse domains. A number of Deep 
Learning algorithms were implemented in this study to detect dates palm disease in the Laki 
Marwat Palm farm in KPK, Pakistan. The efficacy of these algorithms was assessed using 
recall, precision, F1-score, and accuracy. Among the deep learning approaches tested, 
ResNet-50 outperformed the competition with a score accuracy of 98.94, a f1 score of 0.99, a 
precision of 0.99%, and a recall of 0.98%. The proposed study's results showed that deep 
learning is highly recommended for helping experts and farmers in early diseases detection.

 **Problem Statement**

 
The manual inspection of date palm trees for disease detection is time-consuming, subjective, 
and prone to errors. Farmers and agricultural experts often struggle to accurately identify 
diseases at an early stage, resulting in delayed or ineffective treatments. Therefore, It is 
necessary to have an automated and reliable apparatus that can swiftly detect diseases, 
enabling timely intervention and effective disease management. 

**Objective**

Creating a system that uses deep learning to identify diseases in date palm plants is the main 
objective of this research. Here are the particular goals: 

● Creating a large dataset of date palm leaf photos, both healthy and damaged, with 
descriptive labels.

● Training and fine-tuning deep learning models to accurately classify and localize date 
palm diseases.

● Developing a user-friendly interface that makes it simple to interact and understand 
the results.

● Evaluating the accuracy of the recommended system's performance, speed, and 
robustness.
