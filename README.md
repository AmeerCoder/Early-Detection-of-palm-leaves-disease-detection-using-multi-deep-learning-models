**Project Title Early Detection of Palm Leaves Disease Dectection using deep learning models** 


`**Abstract**`
Palm trees are among the earliest species known to humanity, having been cultivated since 
antiquity. Heavenly religions bestowed reverence upon palm trees and devoted considerable 
attention to their maintenance. Palm cultivation is significant in Arab societies not only 
because it provides nutrition, but also because it is connected with long-standing customs, 
traditions, and social values. In recent times, artificial intelligence has been employed to 
develop predictive models for disease risks across diverse domains. A number of Deep 
Learning algorithms were implemented in this study to detect dates palm disease in the Laki 
Marwat Palm farm in KPK, Pakistan. The efficacy of these algorithms was assessed using 
recall, precision, F1-score, and accuracy. Among the deep learning approaches tested, 
ResNet-50 outperformed the competition with a score accuracy of 98.94, a f1 score of 0.99, a 
precision of 0.99%, and a recall of 0.98%. The proposed study's results showed that deep 
learning is highly recommended for helping experts and farmers in early diseases detection.
